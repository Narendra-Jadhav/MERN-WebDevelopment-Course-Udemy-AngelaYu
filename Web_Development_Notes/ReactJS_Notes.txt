****************** React.js *********************

** A Javascript Library for building User Interfaces
** It is a Frontend Framework

** In ReactJS HTML, CSS, JS are combined and not kept separate and their various 
components are formed.

** So, using ReactJS different components on the Webpage can work differently.
One component can update itself without the page being reloaded.
eg. Notification icon

** React Framework will notice the changes in the components and it will render only 
those components which have changed

#### Create React App: 

1) npm -> it downloads the package. Like buying
2) npx -> it only uses the package and not store it? Like taking on rent

* npx create-react-app my-app => to create my-app directory having all the required files

* npx create-react-app . => if we have a folder already and want all files in that

## To create React APP
1. npx create-react-app my-app
2. cd my-app
3. npm start
