************************ API **************************

API -> Application Programming Interface

-> An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers
 can use to create software or interact with an external system.

eg. jQuery is an API with which we can create softwares
eg. Tinder uses Facebook API to get information about our friends -> so here API is used
to interact with an external system (Facebook Database)

API

1. Endpoint
2. Paths
3. Parameters
4. Authentication

--------------------------

1. Endpoint -> Through endpoint we can get what we want from the API

2. Paths -> eg. in the JokesAPI -> the Endpoint is the basic url and after that category
is added to give specific Path of that
eg. https://---/Programming

3. Parameters -> if there is a option of custom selection we can type/search the keyword of
what we want. So, for that there are Parameters which are key, value pairs
eg. https://----/Programming?contains=debugging

we searched for 'debugging'. The part after '?' is by the Parameter. contains is the
key and debugging is the value.

There can be various such keys as assigned for Parameters

* When we have more than one query, they are separated by '&'

eg. https:// --- /Programming?type=single&contains=debugging

* these '?, &, =' symbols are important


4. Authentication -> 
when some API has useful information like weather details, the API providing company has to
keep a track on the usage of the API by someone.

Every time we make a request through api, they should be able to identify you, and how often 
we are using that as a developer, and charge us accordingly.

eg. openweathermap.org

** How to use such Authenticated API: 
1. Sign up and Sign In on their webpage
2. going to API keys. Copy the whole key
3. going to thier Documentation, ans seeing how to use that.
The API key has to be put in the Parameter of the URL.

NOTE: the default temperature unit on this website is KElvin. To convert it to Celcius, 
we have to add that Parameter.


**** API KEY got from OpenWeatherMap -> 


**** Endpoint ->
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather

** https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Mumbai&appid=787c33f4061dd537bbb93acbf5d86134&units=metric

for weather of Mumbai,
units=metric for temp in Celcius

# NOTE: The order of the parameters doesn't matter, as long as they are seperated by '&'


--------------------------------------------------------------------

**************** Postman *****************

# Each time testing the API on the browser is not easy

# So, to test the API's we can use -> 'POSTMAN'

After opening Postman

1. Get Request
2. In rrquest URL putting the Endpoint of the API
3. Putting KEY and Values in the table
4. We will get the data in JSON format in a Pretty way

*********************** JSON ***********************

# JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation
-> it is like JavaScript Objects
-> we get the API data in JSON format

# data can be also obtained in other formats like 
XML -> Extensible Markup Language
HTML

# JSON Viewer Pro Extension
