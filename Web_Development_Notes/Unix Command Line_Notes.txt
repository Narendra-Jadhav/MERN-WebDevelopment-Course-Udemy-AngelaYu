**************** The Unix Command Line *****************

## Hyper Terminal

With Pistachio -> Operating System

nut we eat -> Kernal (Hardware)

outer part -> Shell -> User Interface -> helps us to interact with the kernal 


* Shell/User Interface is of two types: 

1. GUI -> Graphical User Interface 
(where we can directly see and open the files, directories, etc by clicking)

2. CLI -> Command Line Interface -> where we have to write commands


* Bash Shell -> Bash (Bourne Again Shell)
- Bash Shell is the CLI for Unix Systems

eg. Linux runs on Unix like System

NOTES: 

1. '~'(tilde) sign shows that we are inside the 'Users' directory. We are by default inside that


2. 'ls' command -> ls = list -> lists all the files and directories inside that


3. 'cd' command -> cd = change directory -> changes the directory to what we mention


4. NOTE: after we write 2,3 alphabets of the word(directory name) we want we can press 'tab'
to autofill the name


5. 'cd ~' -> it will take us back to the root directory


6. 'cd ..' -> it will take us back to previous directory


7. cd /Users/naren/ -> root directory address
'/' is the Root Directory


8. we can write 'cd' and then drag and drop the folder we want to go to


9. Previous command can be copied using 'Up Arrow' key and below command using 'Down key'


10. Shortcuts: 

* to edit in between the command -> alt + clicking where we want to edit

* to go to the start -> ctrl + a

* to go to the end -> ctrl + e

* to delete the command -> ctrl + u


11. 'mkdir' -> to make a Directory


12. 'touch text.txt' -> to make a file


13. 'start' file name -> to open the file in the default text editor


14. 'pwd' -> pwd = print working directory -> gives the path of the directory we are currently in


15. 'atom' file name -> to open inside Atom


16. 'rm' file name -> rm = remove -> to remove a file
If it asks confirmation -> type 'y' and then 'enter'


17. 'rm *' -> to remove all the files inside a directory


18. 'rmdir' directory or 'rm -r' directory -> to remove a directory


19. sudo -> Super User Do -> has Admin Priviledge


20. rm -rf -> rf stands for remove forcefully -> not asking for confirmation


21. rm -rf --no-preserve-root -> do not preserve anything about that on the hard-disk
